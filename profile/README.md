👋 Hi there!

Welcome to where future KFC workers gather, we’re a group of Computer Science students from The University of the West Indies.
We built this organization to collaborate on projects, learn new things, and occasionally question our life choices during debugging sessions.

🙋‍♀️ About Us

We’re passionate about software development, system design, and experimenting with new technologies.
This organization is where we bring our class ideas to life (well try to), from fun prototypes to full-on academic projects.

🌈 Contribution Guidelines

Want to contribute?

Feel free to open a pull request or reach out to the project owners for collaboration.

Be kind, write clean code, and comment like your future self will forget everything (because you will).

👩‍💻 Useful Resources

Nothing fancy yet, documentation and guides are coming soon, probably™.
For now, just explore the repos and follow the commit chaos.

🍿 Fun Facts

Breakfast of champions: bread, cheese paste, and a healthy dose of sleep deprivation.

Side effects include mild delusion and the occasional breakthrough moment at 3 AM.
